### 🛠 Technical Focus Points

* **System Operation:** While clean code isn't always possible, I aim to produce efficient and fast code using a *less is more* approach.
* **Creativity:** Rather than using ready-made solutions, I always lean towards creating from scratch; this helps me both grow and generate new ideas.

### 🔬 Interests & Research

* **Olympiads:** Complex algorithms and mathematics.
* **Future Mobility:** Research and development on **Autonomous and Electric Vehicle** systems.
* **Game Development:** Performance-oriented game engines and project workflows.
* **Architectural Touches:** Structural improvements that enhance the operational efficiency of systems.
